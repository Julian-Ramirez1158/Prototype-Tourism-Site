This project serves as a basic prototype tourism website. This website allows users to access important and pertinent tourism information when visiting the fictional tropical island of "Taniti". Users will be able to navigate the site to learn about activities, entertainment, transportation, and general information about the island. The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, Font Awesome, and Boostrap. The site can improve by elevating the general styling of the home page as well as integrating secondary navigation options on the content pages.
